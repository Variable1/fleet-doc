# Using Auth tokens

In this section, we'll look at passing Authorization and Authentication information in our requests, by accessing the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

Let's try making a `GET` request to the URL `https://api.github.com/user`.

You'll get the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "Requires authentication",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/users#get-the-authenticated-user"
}
```

This is beacause you are not authorized to access the API and inorder to gain access you would need to authenticate yourself. We use tokens to authenticate a user and to do so we first need to generate an access token from GitHub.

## Generating access token

To get access to the GitHub API, you first need to generate a personal access token. For our demonstration we will generate one granting access to public repositories.

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Goto your [personal access tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click on generate new token
3. Select tokens (classic)
4. You should see a page like the one below:

    ::image
    ---
    src: getting-started/rest/github-access-token
    extension: png
    alt: Create GitHub Access Token
    ---
    ::

5. Specify the note as "Hoppscotch API" so that you can remember why you created it
6. Under the "Select scopes" section only check `public_repo`
7. Scoll down and click on `Generate token`
8. You just generated your access token, now copy the token to your clipboard

## Storing auth token in a variable

::alert{type="info"}
::list{type="info"}

- It is a recommended safe-practice to have your auth details in environment variables rather than inputting it directly to the authorization tab.

::
::

1. Click on the `Global` environment to add a variable
2. Create a variable called `token` and paste the token from GitHub as it's value

    ::image
    ---
    src: getting-started/rest/create-token-variable
    extension: png
    alt: Auth token variable
    ---
    ::

3. Now open the Authorization tab and select `Bearer` from the dropdown list
4. Input the token as shown below, make sure that you reference the token in variable format, ie `<<token>>`

    ::image
    ---
    src: getting-started/rest/add-token-in-auth-tab
    extension: png
    alt: Add token in Auth tab
    ---
    ::

5. Click on "**Send**"

You should now see the response including details about your GitHub account.
