# Interceptor

You can access APIs blocked by CORS restriction by using either Proxyscotch or custom middleware. You can also use the Hoppscotch web extension.

## Proxy

- Enable proxy from "**Settings**".
- You can replace Proxy URL with your own proxy middleware if you wish.

::

## Middleware

Since CORS is as simple as adding some HTTP headers, and itâ€™s the only browser blocked. You can build some proxy-like component that will basically make a call for you and get the response from the desired API. You add it to the headers, and then send it back to Hoppscotch.

## Browser extension

1. Install the browser extension from the below links:

   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld?hl=en)
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hoppscotch)

2. Click on the Hoppscotch Browser Extension icon from browser toolbar and add a new origin as `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8000` as per your local server configuration.
