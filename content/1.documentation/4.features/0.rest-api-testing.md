Hoppscotch's REST API platform provides you a fast and seamless experience to test and debug your API endpoints.

It's primarily divided into two sections along with other features to help you build better APIs.

## Request

The request section provides you the capability to define your API endpoint and initiate the communication.

You can select from a range of HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` etc. You can read more about HTTP methods [here](/documentation/protocols/rest).

You can also add dynamic behaviours to your requests by specifying `Headers`, `Request Body`, `Authorization Headers`, `Parameters` and `Pre-request scripts`.

Hoppscotch also provides the capability to run `Tests` on the responses you receive.

## Response

This is where you see the responses to your API endpoints. You can download and copy the returned responses for further use.

## Other features

The REST API platform also houses other features like:
