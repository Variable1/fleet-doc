# Environments

An environment helps you create variables that you can reuse in requests and scripts. Environments are also useful when you need to manage shared data with a team.

Click on the "**Environments**" icon on the sidebar to create environments.

::alert{type="info"}
::list{type="info"}

- You can add your variables to `Global` environment, which can be accessed globally, ie. in every other evironments.
