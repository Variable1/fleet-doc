Hoppscotch's Realtime API platform helps you test your realtime APIs easily.

It's primarily divided into two sections the request section and the response section.

## Request

The request section houses the feature to enter you server endpoint and initiate a connection. You also get the option to choose from four different protocols `WebSocket`, `SSE`, `Socket.IO`, and `MQTT`

## Response

Once the connection is established, you can view the responses and logs in the response section.
